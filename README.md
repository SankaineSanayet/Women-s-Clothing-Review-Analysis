# Women's Clothing E-Commerce Reviews Sentiment Analysis
This project is part of the Moringa Phase 4 final project.

# Overview
In the fast-growing e-commerce industry, customer reviews play a crucial role in shaping brand perception, influencing purchases and identifying areas for improvement. This project focuses on analyzing women’s clothing reviews to extract meaningful insights using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data science techniques.

By leveraging sentiment analysis, text preprocessing and machine learning, we aim to classify customer sentiment, uncover key themes and provide actionable insights that businesses can use to enhance customer experience.

# Business Understanding
The primary objective of this analysis is to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on women’s e-commerce clothing reviews. This will help businesses extract valuable insights from customer feedback and enhance decision-making.

**Refined Objectives:**  
- **Sentiment Classification:**  
  - Develop a robust NLP-based sentiment classifier that categorizes customer reviews into two sentiment classes (Positive, Negative).  
  - Use “Review Text” as the primary feature and leverage “Recommended IND” as proxy labels to define sentiment.
  - Target a performance benchmark of at least 80% accuracy and an F1-Score of 0.80 on the test set.
- **Topic Modeling & Key Themes Identification:**  
  - Apply topic modeling (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to the review text to uncover prevalent themes such as product quality, customer service, pricing, and delivery experience.
- **Actionable Insights & Stakeholder Communication:**  
  - Generate comprehensive visualizations (e.g., word clouds, topic distributions) and interpret the results to provide actionable recommendations for product improvements and customer engagement.

**Stakeholders & Business Value:**  
- **Marketing, Product, and Customer Service Teams:**  
  - Can use these insights to optimize product offerings, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive strategic improvements.
